# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - Released 2019-03-23
- Refactored filters into class based structure so that any number of filters can be added in the future.
- Added `Disposition` class to parse multipart form post bodies.
- Refactored `WithForm` class to work with both URL encoded and multipart forms.
- Refactored `withJson` functionality to be more in-line with most other filters. Now, by default, the expectation returns true if the body contains a stringified version of the passed argument. A new `$exclusive` boolean value can be passed as the second argument to return to the previous exact match nature. The new signature is `withJson(array $json, bool $exclusive = false)`.
