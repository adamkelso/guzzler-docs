# Expectations

Expectations are the objects you use to define what properties of a request that should be searched for. Rather than instantiating an  `Expectation` directly, you should receive an instance from the main `expects()` method, or in a closure you pass to an [assertion method](assertions.md).

### expects(InvokedRecorder $times, $message = message)

To mimic the chainable syntax of PHPUnit mock objects, you can create expectations with PHPUnitâ€™s own InvokedRecorders and the `expects()` method. InvokedRecorders are methods like `$this->once()`, `$this->lessThan($int)`, `$this->never()`, and so on. You may also pass an optional message to be used on errors as the second argument.

```php
public function testExample()
{
    $expectation = $this->guzzler->expects($this->once());
}
```

> All methods on expectations are chainable and can lead directly into another method. `$expectation->oneMethod()->anotherMethod()->stillAnother();`

### endpoint(string $uri, string $verb), {verb}(string $uri)

To specify the endpoint and method used for an expectation, use the `endpoint()` method or any of the convenience endpoint verb methods.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->endpoint("/some-url", "GET");
```

The following convenience verb methods are also available to shorten your endpoint expectations. `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`,  `patch`, `options`.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->any())
    ->get("/a-url-for-getting");
```

### withHeader(string $key, string|array $value)

If you would like to expect a certain header to be on a request, you can provide the header and itâ€™s value.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withHeader("Authorization", "some-access-token");
```

You can chain together multiple calls to `withHeader()` to individually add different headers. Headers can also be an array of values.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withHeader("Accept-Encoding", ["gzip", "deflate"])
    ->withHeader("Accept", "application/json");
```

### withHeaders(array $headers)

As a shorthand for multiple `withHeader()` calls, you can pass an array of header keys and values to `withHeaders()`.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withHeaders([
        "Accept-Encoding" => ["gzip", "deflate"],
        "Accept" => "application/json"
    ]);
```

### withBody(string $body)

You can expect a certain body on any request by passing a `$body` string to the `withBody()` method.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withBody("some body string");

// Or, a json based request
    ->withBody(json_encode($someJsonableStructure));
```

### withProtocol($protocol)

You can expect a certain HTTP protocol (1.0, 1.1, 2.0) using the `withProtocol()` method.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withProtocol(2.0);
```

### withOption(string $name, string $value)

You can expect a certain Guzzle Client/Request option by passing a name and value to this method.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withOption('stream', true);
```

You can chain together multiple calls to `withOption` to individually add more option values.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withOption('stream', true)
    ->withOption('allow_redirects', false);
```

### withOptions(array $options)

As a shorthand for multiple `withOption()` calls, you can pass an array of option keys and values to `withOptions()`.

```php
$this->guzzler->expects($this->once())
    ->withOptions([
        'stream' => true,
        'verify' => false,
        'allow_redirects' => false
    ]);
```
